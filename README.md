# KatzenWL (CatWl):

# How to build:
To build either use the Meson & Ninja toolchain or Muon and Samu toolchain or mix and match them. Meson is just showen below as it's the more popular and thus the toolchain your more likely to just happen to have. But if you use Muon or Samurai just change the program names out.

```sh
    meson setup build

    ninja -C build
```

# Trivia:
- The name is litterally just because I like cats and am learning German
